            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
              ShopMitra was born from a simple idea by a group of students: to empower the local shopkeepers who are the backbone of our communities. We saw them struggling with the complexities of digital tools, marketing, and finding reliable help. So, we created a single, trustworthy platform to solve all their problems. We're not just a service; we are a "mitra" â€“ a friend to every shop owner.
